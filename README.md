# Online Notes

This repository contains online notes written by [Bjorn Sandstede](http://bjornsandstede.com).

* __Absolute spectra__: Gives a brief overview of spectra of PDE operators on large bounded interval and their limit as the interval length goes to infinity

* __Evans function example__: Contains a nonlinear heat equation that admits a stationary localized wave whose Evans function can be calculated explicitly

* __Dynamics of wave trains__: Gives an overview of the existence and stability of wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems, including results on modulation equations

* __Spatial dynamics__: Contains an overview of spatial dynamics with applications to essential instabilities

* __Travelling waves__: Contains an outline of existence and stability properties of travelling-wave solutions of reaction-diffusion systems on the real line
