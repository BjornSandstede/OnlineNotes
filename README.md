# Online Notes

This repository contains online notes written by [Bjorn Sandstede](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/sandsted/).

* __Absolute spectra__: Gives a brief overview of spectra of PDE operators on large bounded interval and their limit as the interval length goes to infinity

* __Evans function example__: Gives a nonlinear heat equation that admits a stationary localized wave whose Evans function can be calculated explicitly

* __Dynamics of wave trains__: Gives an overview of the existdence and stability of wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems, including results on modulation equations

* __Spatial dynamics__: Gives an overview of spatial dynamics with applications to essential instabilities

* __Travelling waves__: Gives an outline of existence and stability properties of travelling-wave solutions of reaction-diffusion systemns on the real line
